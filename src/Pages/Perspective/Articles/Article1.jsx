              There are glaring weaknesses in Nigeria’s governance and social
              structure. With the testimonies and evidence making the rounds in
              the past couple of year, it is clear that the Nigerian youth had a
              legitimate cause protesting against police brutality. The largely
              peaceful and orderly protests nationwide show that our young
              citizens have come of age and deserve and have earned the
              opportunity to be major stakeholders in building a new Nigeria of
              our dreams. On the topic of nation-building, infrastructure has a
              great role to play in that regard. Now, we must recognize that
              infrastructure is basically of two kinds, namely: human
              infrastructure and physical infrastructure. Sadly, the hijacking
              of the #endSARS protests by jobless and irate youths led to the
              reckless destruction of public infrastructure in major cities
              across Nigeria. Two choices confront our youth: they will come to
              our window, either to fix it or break into it.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              This could have been avoided, considering the fact that the anger
              and frustration of Nigeria’s youth population have been tethering
              on the edge for so long and was only waiting for an opportunity to
              reach a boiling point. Over the years, we failed as a nation to
              leverage this strategic human asset which has now snowballed into
              the current crisis. Some official estimates suggest that it will
              require at least three trillion naira to rebuild the physical
              infrastructure destroyed, vandalized or burnt down. This is a huge
              setback from an economic perspective. “You and I come by road or
              rail,” said former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, “but
              economists travel on infrastructure.” The point is that our
              prosperity as a nation depends on infrastructure – both human and
              physical. For every building destroyed, some businesses would
              close, more jobs would disappear, more tax revenues which should
              have been used to expand already grossly inadequate public
              infrastructure would now be diverted into rebuilding damaged ones.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The events of the past three weeks have brought back to the fore
              the urgent need to prize and prioritize public infrastructure. And
              closely connected to that, we also need to develop our human
              infrastructure too. An adage says, if we refuse to build a child’s
              useful capacity, he will end up to destroying the building we have
              erected. As a nation, we must put measures in place to develop and
              protect both our human and physical infrastructure at all times,
              especially in times of social unrest.”
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              From the point of view of asset management, we need a
              reorientation of our citizens to understand that public buildings
              and other assets, including vehicles, street furniture and other
              public utilities do not belong to politicians. Public
              infrastructure belongs to all of us. A broken road affects all of
              us, not just political officeholders. Politicians are not the ones
              who ride on public buses to work. We, the citizens are the one who
              needs the buses to move about more cheaply. When people destroy or
              burn down police stations so that security personnel have no
              offices to operate from, we the people are more vulnerable; the
              political class have access to security.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Let’s take a deeper look at some of the impacts of the destruction
              of public infrastructure on our national productivity: The
              destruction of our courthouses and the judicial documents will
              further impede an already slow and inefficient judicial process.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              With the statewide curfew being eased, people have begun commuting
              to work, the terrible effect of burning over 150 buses was brought
              home as thousands of commuters waited for hours at BRT bus
              stations across Lagos state. Lagos needs at least 1,000 additional
              buses to ease public transportation, the loss of plus 150 of the
              existing ones which are grossly inadequate means not only more
              hardship for commuters but lesser productivity at work as people
              arrive late or not at all.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              In a number of locations, hoodlums vandalized the electrical
              network of distribution companies (Discos). It goes without saying
              that power supply to those areas would be seriously affected.
              Budgeted funds which should be used to strengthen the currently
              weak and inadequate infrastructure will now go into rectifying the
              damaged network at greater cost and more delays. Ironically, some
              of those who participated in the vandalism complain that they
              don’t have an adequate power supply. What about the damage to fire
              stations and how that potentially impact citizens when such
              services are critically needed?
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              All this ruckus further reinforces the maintenance cultured
              campaign that we must digitize our management of public assets and
              not rely solely on archaic and easily manipulated paper records.
              Beyond reorientation of our citizens to the preservation of public
              infrastructure, we need to engage our youth in our public asset
              maintenance culture. The strident complaints about increasing
              unemployment among Nigeria’s youth population can to a large
              extent tackled by focusing seriously on infrastructure. Michael
              Bloomberg put it very clearly by saying “We can only create good
              jobs if we make a smarter investment in infrastructure.”
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Investment in upskilling our youth cannot be overemphasized and we
              as a society have to find ways to bridge the yawning gap between
              human and physical infrastructure to make meaningful progress. The
              expansive asset management space offers a great opportunity to do
              just that. If the enabling environment is created, the Nigeria
              youth, regardless of their skill level, can fit into a very wide
              range of jobs in the value chain. Data and information management
              is an area our teeming technology-savvy youth can unleash their
              talents. There is also the professional cadre where engineers,
              architects, builders etc can find useful employment. Others can be
              trained and deployed as artisans to work in maintenance, repair
              and refurbishment.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              There is a great opportunity for Job creation through the
              formation of a localized maintenance ecosystem/economy – an
              opportunity to plough the energies of local youth towards the
              maintenance of Public Assets within their vicinity. The components
              of the asset management value chain; from our youth demographic
              can be plugged into – from data collection & digitization to other
              functions such as implementation, where skilled labour can
              develop, repair and refurbish infrastructure assets, energy and
              water management, building services and operations, health, safety
              and hygiene and housekeeping. Thousands of our youth can be
              absorbed into this sector which will have a tremendous impact in
              decreasing the spiralling unemployment rate, encourage ownership &
              collective protection of public assets and instil in our citizens
              the idea that government property is our collective heritage and
              we all must do what we can to protect and sustain them.There is a
